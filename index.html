    <div class="introduction">
        <p>About six months ago I began learning to code. I took some classes from CodeCademy and did some work with freeCodeCamp. Eventually I landed on The Odin Project and found it to be the most helpful free coding resource. At the time of writing it is July 11, 2022 and I revisisted this project to practice adding style to a website.
